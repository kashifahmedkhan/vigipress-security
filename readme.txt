== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this slow down my site? =

No. VigiPress adds less than 10ms to page load time. Most security plugins add 200ms+.

= Do I need to configure anything? =

Not if you don't want to. Click "Fix All Issues" and VigiPress applies optimal security settings automatically.

= What happens if I get locked out? =

Lockouts expire automatically (default: 15 minutes). You can also disable the plugin via FTP if needed.

= Does this work with WooCommerce? =

Yes. VigiPress is compatible with all major plugins including WooCommerce, Contact Form 7, and Yoast SEO.

= Can I see what's being blocked? =

Yes. Go to VigiPress Security → Activity Log to see all security events, failed logins, and blocked IPs.

= Will this conflict with other security plugins? =

It's not recommended to run multiple security plugins. Choose one and stick with it. VigiPress is designed to be your only security plugin.
